# Unsupervised_learning_Case_Study

This is a case study i done in 2022 Fall for Gatech CS7641 Machine Learning Course for unsupervised learning/clustering. 

What is in it:
- Dry Bean Dataset from UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset
- Adult Income Dataset from UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult
- Comparsion of Kmeans cluster, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Kprototypes (Kmeans+Kmodes) in context of these two dataset
- Application of dimensionaility reduction technique: Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Random Component Analysis (RCA), Features Selection with Decision Tree (DT) on top of previous clustering model.
- Disscussion of these model performance and unique features of each class of model in contexts of two dataset.
